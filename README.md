# Requirements

#### List View:

üç∫ The application has a main interface/page which shows a list of beers withbasic details like name, tagline, image, and abv value.
üç∫ The list should be paginated, and should support basic page navigation to see more beer options.

#### Search:

üç∫ The main page also supports searchable interface, where users can search
for a particular beer by name.

#### Detail View:

üç∫ When a user clicks on a particular beer item, they should end up on a beer detail view, where we display detailed information about a beer. Here, feel free to add more details you will like to see apart from the basic ones.

## Bonus Points

üç∫ To extend search functionality, implement ABV filters which show a list of beers
depending upon ABV value being lower or higher than a value chosen by the user.
Support autocomplete in search interface, displaying a list of beers based on search-text entered by the user.
Whenever a user searches for a particular beer using search and filters, they want to share the results with their friends. Support query friendly URLs.
Mobile Responsiveness.
Implement component unit tests.

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can‚Äôt go back!**

If you aren‚Äôt satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you‚Äôre on your own.

You don‚Äôt have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn‚Äôt feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn‚Äôt be useful if you couldn‚Äôt customize it when you are ready for it.
